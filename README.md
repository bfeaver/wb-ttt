[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bfeaver/wb-ttt.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bfeaver/wb-ttt)

## Installation

The following two commands will get you up and running. I assume you already
know how to get or have composer installed. But just in case, here are the
[instructions][1].

```
$ vagrant up
$ composer install
$ app/console assetic:dump
```

## Running

Just browse locally to http://localhost:8080/app_dev.php and the game will load.
